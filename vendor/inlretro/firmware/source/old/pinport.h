//=======================================================
// 
// uncomment define if buiding for either of the first two versions
//#define PURPLE_KAZZO

// First printed circuit board version
// only handful made (less than 10?)
// Purple solder mask
// Labeled "Kazzo PCB rev 3.0"
// Dated 8/22/2011
// * Only contained NES and Famicom connectors
// * Had bug where USB data lines mixed up
// 	-manually fixed during component assembly
// * Naruko determined this should have still been v1 board
// 	-due to it's overall design and conflicting with someother v3 board
// * This was my first ever PCB design and one of the first
// 	times designing something for the NES/FC.  Looking
// 	back at the design there were some very noob decisions...
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
// 	EXP9 - PD1/LED jumper
// 		when closed, PD1 controls NES EXP9 and LED
// 		when open, EXP9 is floating PD1 only controls LED
// 		NES EXP9 was connected to GND pin #16 on FC
// 		-I must have thought that GND pin could serve 
// 			different purpose..
// 		-Result is PD1 is shorted to GND when FC cart inserted
// 			and jumper closed..
// 		Believe I closed this jumper on units I shipped
// 			prob should have left it open..
//		Suggested fix: leave open and ground EXP9
//			-prevents issue with LED when FC cart inserted
//			-minor draw back no access to EXP9
// 	ALOG - EXP6 - DIGI jumper
// 		another noob jumper decision...
// 		ALOG is the MCU AREF pin which should be tied to VCC
// 			-I thought it was an analog in apparently...
// 		DIGI is EXP flip flop Q6 output
// 		Best position for this jumper is EXP6-DIGI
// 		ALOG pad should be tied to VCC with jumper..
// 		Doing that would make it similar to future designs.
// 		Don't think I shipped any with ALOG jumper closed
// 		NES EXP6 is tied to Famicom pin 46 (Sound to RF)
// 	Expansion port FlipFlop /OE - CLK
// 		Aside from lame jumper design above, biggest difference 
// 		between this PCB version and future ones.
// 		-EXP FF /OE controlled by MCU PD7
// 		-EXP FF CLK controlled by MCU PC3
// 		Future versions control both /OE and CLK with PD7
// 			-this frees PC3 for user use
// 	Both FlipFlops D i/p are driven by Data bus (PORT B)
//
//
// Second printed circuit board version
// only handful made (about a dozen?)
// Purple solder mask
// Labeled "Kazzo PCB rev 1.1"
// Dated 8/22/2011
// * Only contained NES and Famicom connectors
// * Identical to version above aside from the following
// * Corrected bug where USB data lines mixed up
// * Changed silkscreen to v1.1 as suggested by naruko
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
//	-Same as version above as far as I know.
//
//
// uncomment define if buiding for this versions
//#define GREEN_KAZZO
//
// Third printed circuit board version
// only handful made (about ten?) used primarily as SNES prototype
// Green solder mask
// Labeled "Retro programmer/dumper v1.2"  "Kazzo 1.x"
// Dated Apr 2013
// * First version to add SNES connector along with NES & FC
// * Removed noob jumpers from purple versions above.
// 	-grouned FC pin16 as it should have been.  
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
//	-EXP FF /OE still controlled by MCU PD7
//	-MCU PC7 controls both CLK on both FF's.
//	-EXP FF D inputs are PORTA 
//		all other versions are driven by PORTB
//		This means you always have to clock both flipflops
//		Place desired value on PORTA/B respectively and clock with PD7
//	-PC3 is free for user use.
//	-SNES /RESET pin not controlled by PD0 (EXP0)
//		instead it's controlled by A20 (EXPFF Q4)
//		prevents putting INL SNES boards in program mode unless A20 is also low
//		pretty much makes flashing SNES boards a royal PITA/impossible
//		Suggested fix is to have PD0 (EXP0) control SNES /RESET
//		would have to free /RESET and wire to EXP0/PD0 to permit flashing/reading  INL SNES board.
// 
// 
// Fourth printed circuit board version
// First volume PCB run ~300 copies
// Yellow solder mask
// Labeled "Retro programmer/dumper v1.2b"  "Kazzo 1.x"
// Dated May 2013
// * Includes NES, Famicom, & SNES connector
// * SNES board must be removed from case and slid all the way to right
// * Pitch offset on SNES connector makes it difficult to connect with original SNES boards.
// 	-Connector designed to only provide support for INL SNES Hi/Lo-ROM boards.
// * Care must be excersized not to insert SNES board backwards applying reverse power.
// * Effectively Final circuit design after lessons learned on small batches that preceeded.
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
//	-EXP FF /OE & CLK controlled by MCU PD7
//	-MCU PC7 only controls CLK on ADDR HIGH FF.
//	-EXP & ADDRHI FF D inputs both on Data bus PORTB 
//	-PC3 is free for user use.
//	-SNES /RESET pin controlled by PD0 (EXP0)
//	-Retains prev ver fixes, nothing funny going on with jumpers FC GND pin #16
//	
//
// Fifth printed circuit board version
// Second volume PCB run ~500 copies
// Yellow solder mask
// Labeled "Retro programmer/dumper v1.2b"  "Kazzo 1.x"
// Dated OCT 2014
// * Includes NES, Famicom, & SNES connector
// * SNES connector setup/cautions just like the prev version.
// * No significant changes from previous version.
// 	-Changed MCU clock to Crystal instead of resonator in prev ver.
// 	-Added screw mount holes, although not very well placed.
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
// 	-None from previous version
//
//
// Sixth printed circuit board version
// Third volume PCB run in production as of 1NOV2016
// Orange solder mask
// Labeled "Retro programmer/dumper v1.4"  "Kazzo 1.x"
// Dated OCT 2016
// Addition of fancy INL logo for first time
// * Includes NES, Famicom, & SNES connector
// * SNES connector improvement to correct pitch issue with prev ver.
// * Addition of PCT resettable fuse on incoming power.
// 	-Provides protection to SNES boards inserted backwards.
// * Rearrangement of BL/RUN switch and screw holes for better case design.
// * Cut out buzzer pads (PD6) from under MCU which was never developed.
// * INPUT/OUTPUT differences:
// 	-None from previous version
