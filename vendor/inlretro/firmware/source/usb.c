/* This function is called when the driver receives a SETUP transaction from
 * the host which is not answered by the driver itself (in practice: class and
 * vendor requests). All control transfers start with a SETUP transaction where
 * the host communicates the parameters of the following (optional) data
 * transfer. The SETUP data is available in the 'data' parameter which can
 * (and should) be casted to 'usbRequest_t *' for a more user-friendly access
 * to parameters.
 *
 * If the SETUP indicates a control-in transfer, you should provide the
 * requested data to the driver. There are two ways to transfer this data:
 * (1) Set the global pointer 'usbMsgPtr' to the base of the static RAM data
 * block and return the length of the data in 'usbFunctionSetup()'. The driver
 * will handle the rest. Or (2) return USB_NO_MSG in 'usbFunctionSetup()'. The
 * driver will then call 'usbFunctionRead()' when data is needed. See the
 * documentation for usbFunctionRead() for details.
 *
 * If the SETUP indicates a control-out transfer, the only way to receive the
 * data from the host is through the 'usbFunctionWrite()' call. If you
 * implement this function, you must return USB_NO_MSG in 'usbFunctionSetup()'
 * to indicate that 'usbFunctionWrite()' should be used. See the documentation
 * of this function for more information. If you just want to ignore the data
 * sent by the host, return 0 in 'usbFunctionSetup()'.
 *
 * Note that calls to the functions usbFunctionRead() and usbFunctionWrite()
 * are only done if enabled by the configuration in usbconfig.h.
